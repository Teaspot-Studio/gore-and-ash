-- | Average framerate over the last given number of samples.  One
-- important thing to note is that the value of this wire will generally
-- disagree with 'sAvg' composed with 'framerate'.  This is expected,
-- because this wire simply calculates the arithmetic mean, whereas
-- 'sAvg' will actually integrate the framerate graph.
--
-- Note:  This wire is for debugging purposes only, because it exposes
-- discrete time.  Do not taint your application with discrete time.
--
